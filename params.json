{"name":"Project1","tagline":"Random Trivia","body":"Project 1: Random Trivia\r\nThis is a game of skill and comedy to test your knowledge about some cool stuff.\r\n\r\nUser Stories:\r\n1. As a user, I should be able to input answers to prompted questions. DONE\r\n2. As a user, I should be able to visually select questions in order. DONE\r\n3. As a user, I should be able to see my score at the end of the game. DONE\r\n4. ** As a user, I should be able to compare my scores to others'. **\r\n5. As a user, I should be able to enter my name. DONE\r\n6. As a user, I should be able to start a new game. DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nHTML/CSS pseudocode\r\n-create divs for each question/card DONE\r\n-create button to start new game DONE\r\n-create score card DONE\r\n-** create button to see high scores **\r\n\r\n\r\nDONE = complete\r\n** = icebox items\r\n\r\nFinal Remarks:\r\nI attempted the high score list part of the bonus but I could not figure out persistent storage. Instead I added a surprise button. My code is not as DRY as I'd like it to be, but having each box/question as an independent element made it difficult to organize. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
