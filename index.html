      <p>Project 1: Random Trivia
This is a game of skill and comedy to test your knowledge about some cool stuff.</p>

<p>User Stories:
1. As a user, I should be able to input answers to prompted questions. DONE
2. As a user, I should be able to visually select questions in order. DONE
3. As a user, I should be able to see my score at the end of the game. DONE
4. ** As a user, I should be able to compare my scores to others'. **
5. As a user, I should be able to enter my name. DONE
6. As a user, I should be able to start a new game. DONE</p>

<p>HTML/CSS pseudocode
-create divs for each question/card DONE
-create button to start new game DONE
-create score card DONE
-** create button to see high scores **</p>

<p>DONE = complete
** = icebox items</p>

<p>Final Remarks:
I attempted the high score list part of the bonus but I could not figure out persistent storage. Instead I added a surprise button. My code is not as DRY as I'd like it to be, but having each box/question as an independent element made it difficult to organize. </p>
